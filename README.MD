My api wrapper is almost finished. Well, I finished the sync part, just need to add async, the code isn't the best, I didn't use the callback function. If anyone wants to use this code with a callback feel free to do so, if you jsut plain up copy this code, I will not be happy. If there is anyone who can improve this Thank you.
